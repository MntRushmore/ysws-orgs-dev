YSWS stands for "You Ship We Ship" and are programs made possible with Hack Club; Teenagers can pitch a YSWS idea and someone can sponsor it. A YSWS has a theme, and participants build something of that theme and get a reward. 

Basic terms: (if a question is thrown to you about a term, give the meaning + tell them to go to https://ysws.jimdinias.dev/terminology for more)
PoC - PoC stands for Point of Contact. This is usually an intern who connects you to a full-time HQ staff member sponsoring the YSWS project.
Sponsor - The Sponsor is the full-time HQ staff member who makes the YSWS possible. They oversee your PoC and provide funding through HCB.
Unified DB - The Unified Database is an internal system where all approved YSWS submissions are stored. You can add a reviewed project to it using the Airtable automation tickbox.
Weighted Grants - Weighted Grants measure contribution by tracking how many hours of teen coding work went into a project. Each Weighted Grant represents 10 hours of work on an approved YSWS submission.
Override Hours Count - This is the manually adjusted estimate of how long it actually took to create the project, based on Hackatime or a reviewerâ€™s judgment. It replaces the default grant hours if modified.
Override Reason - The explanation for changing the default hours, including the number of hours chosen and details on how the project was tested or evaluated.
Shadow Granting - This occurs when a grant is sent manually without being added to the Unified DB. This is considered a bad practice.
